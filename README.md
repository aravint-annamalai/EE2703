This contains the assignments done by me as a part of the Applied Programming Lab course at IIT, Madras during the semester Jan-May, 2020 (my 4th semester). 
This is a course aimed to introduce the Python language to the students and performing operations that were/are a part of our curriculum in the previous/current semesters using the various tools available in Python.
